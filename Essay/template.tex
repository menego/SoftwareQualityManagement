\begin{abstract}

This is the abstract of the template document. It serves only as a starting point for editing. The title is an example with Topic 1. Similarly, you can choose Topic 2 -- ``..'' or 3 -- ``..''. Additionally, you can add an alternative title. It can be a telling or even funny reference to your particular context.

\section{Introduction}

During the last decade we experienced a big change in the way software is developed and distributed. In this regard, cloud computing plays a crucial part where all the rules of classical software development are evolving to address the ubiquity and the faster time to market demands. An example of new architecture that leverages cloud computing is given by micro services, in which applications are essentially a composition of independent, uncoupled entities that communicate between each other. New roles emerged, such as DevOps, where development and operation converge into a single figure with the ability to implement the high level of automation required by this new approach. Consolidated techniques like object oriented programming are shifting to a more abstracted paradigm such as MDE (Model Driven Engineering) where models are the building blocks of software systems, separating design and logic from implementation details~\cite{overview-platforms, fuggetta2014software}. All these innovations are still growing towards maturity and they bring  a whole new set of challenges and considerations that are the subject of this essay.

\section{Ideas}

Following the considerations exposed in the introduction I formulated 3 research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
 	\item In this new landscape characterized by the convergence towards 'everything as a service' and the increasing abstraction of processes~\cite{automatic-dev}, how is software development impacted? What is the main trend in this regard?
 	\item In light of all the considerations we made about the requirements that cloud services development imply. What are the changes in the software development tool-chain? 
	\item How can we improve and standardize security methodologies for cloud software development?
\end{enumerate}
